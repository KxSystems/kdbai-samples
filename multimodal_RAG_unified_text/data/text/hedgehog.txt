Hedgehogs are small, nocturnal mammals known for their distinctive spines, which are modified hairs. These spines provide protection against predators. Hedgehogs have a rounded body, a short tail, and a pointed snout. They are primarily insectivores, eating insects, snails, and other small creatures. Hedgehogs are found in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and have also been introduced to New Zealand.
