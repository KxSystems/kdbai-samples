Bats are the only mammals capable of sustained flight, distinct from flying squirrels which can only glide. They have wings that are more similar to a human hand, with elongated fingers connected by a thin membrane. Bats are often found in dark places like caves and are known for using echolocation to navigate and find food in the dark.
