Deer are hoofed mammals known for their graceful bodies and long legs. Most male deer have antlers, which they shed and regrow annually. They are herbivores, generally feeding on a mix of grasses, plants, and leaves. Deer are found in various habitats across the world, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands.
