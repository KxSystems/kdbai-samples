        "<b>Tip:</b> This sample uses ‘qHNSW’ , a new vector index choice in KDB.AI. It will support the same API options as the existing ‘HNSW’ index but with the significant difference that the index is stored on-disk and memory-mapped as required. This means data inserts will have negligible memory and cpu footprints. The vector index can grow and be searched as long as there is disk space available. Among other cases, this stands out as a great index for memory contrained situations such as edge devices.\n",

        "\n",
        "Semantic search allows users to perform searches based on the meaning or similarity of the data rather than exact matches. It works by converting the query into a vector representation and then finding similar vectors in the database. This way, even if the query and the data in the database are not identical, the system can identify and retrieve the most relevant results based on their semantic meaning.\n",

The pop-\\\\nulation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dominant dynamical formation mechanisms would preferentially harvest more distant, ice-rich planetesimals\\\\nfrom the disks of the source systems. More of the cometary ISO population passing through the Solar System could\\\\nbe detected than rocky ISOs, as comae make cometary ISOs brighter down to smaller diameters (Engelhardt et al.\\\\n2017). 2I/Borisov appeared relatively similar in size and composition to Solar System comets (Jewitt & Seligman\\\\n2022). Its distinctive features were an exceptionally high CO and NH 2content, implying it formed on the edge of its\\\\nhome system\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s protoplanetary disk, beyond the hypervolatile CO ice line (Bodewits et al. 2020; Cordiner et al. 2020).\\\\nHowever, 1I/\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oumuamua had a mix of observed characteristics. A 160-m scale object, it lacked a coma in deep\\\\nimaging (Jewitt et al. 2017) or detectable outgassing in CO, CO 2(Trilling et al. 2018) or CN (Ye et al. 2017). Despite\\\\nthis, it still underwent non-gravitational acceleration similar to that experienced by Solar System comets (Micheli\\\\net al. 2018). The large amplitude of its light curve implied a high-aspect-ratio shape (Mashchenko 2019). At the time,\\\\nthis combination of factors seemed unusual, although the surface reflectance properties were consistent with outer\\\\nSolar System bodies (e.g. Bannister et al. 2017). Hypotheses for the composition and formation of 1I/\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oumuamua\\\\nthat match the limited data remain varied. It may be a planetesimal (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Oumuamua ISSI Team et al. 2019); a fragment\\\\nof a comet devolatized by passages close to its parent star before ejection (Raymond et al. 2018a); an icy fractal\\\\naggregate (Moro-Mart\\\\xc2\\\\xb4 \\\\xc4\\\\xb1n 2019); a hydrogen iceberg formed in a molecular cloud (Seligman & Laughlin 2020); or a\\\\nnitrogen ice fragment from the surface of a Pluto-like dwarf planet (Jackson & Desch 2021). Recently, observation\\\\nof similarly-small near-Earth asteroids have identified objects with the lightcurve amplitudes seen in 1I. Additionally,\\\\nFarnocchia et al. (2023) and Seligman et al. (2023) report six asteroids with significant non-gravitational acceleration\\\\nand no coma. While from the two ISOs found so far, the compositions of interstellar objects are clearly varied, 1I may\\\\nbe less extreme than it was first considered.\\\\nISOs formed in a protoplanetary disk carry information about their home systems in their composition: we have\\\\nsamples of other planetary systems coming to us for study. The composition of a protoplanetary disk correlates with the\\\\nelemental abundances of its central star, due to their formation from the same gas and dust in a molecular cloud core\\\\n(\\\\xc2\\\\xa8Oberg & Bergin 2021). We can thus expect stars of different metallicities to produce ISOs of different compositions.\\\\nThe composition of this gas and dust varies in both space and time as the Galaxy chemically evolves due to stellar\\\\nnucleosynthesis, making the current Galactic ISO population sensitive to the entire history and evolution of the Milky\\\\nWay over cosmic time (Tinsley & Cameron 1974; Lintott et al. 2022). Since the occurrence of planetesimal-scattering\\\\ngiant planets also has a metallicity dependence (Fischer & Valenti 2005), the relative occurrence of ISOs of different\\\\ncompositions will therefore carry information about the Galaxy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s distribution of planetary architectures. Finally, we\\\\nexpect many ISOs to outlive their parent stars, as they occupy a similar environment to Gyr-old Oort cloud comets.\\\\nAt minor-planet sizes, ISOs are not subject to any known destructive forces in the ISM (Guilbert-Lepoutre et al. 2015),\\\\nother than minor erosion by dust, in their frequent passages through molecular clouds (Pfalzner et al. 2020). They\\\\ncould also be disrupted or devolatilised in rare close encounters with stars (Raymond et al. 2018a; Forbes & Loeb\\\\n2019). ISOs thus present the possibility of studying long-lost planetary systems.\\\\nThe Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) (Ivezi\\\\xc2\\\\xb4 c et al. 2019) is predicted to provide\\\\na sample of tens of 1I/\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oumuamua-like ISOs (e.g. Levine et al. 2021), as well as any more 2I/Borisov-like cometary\\\\nISOs that enter our Solar System. This is in addition to the continuing contributions of the NEO surveys and other\\\\nobservatories that found 1I and 2I in the first place (Meech et al. 2017). These will provide a large and varied sample\\\\nof interstellar objects, for study and comparison to predictions.\\\\nThe many dependencies over planetary and Galactic scales make the observed ISO population a fascinating tool:\\\\nit has the potential to test models in both Galaxy and planetary physics, with an entirely different set of biases\\\\nto traditional methods. Lintott et al. (2022) introduced the concept of predicting the composition of a Galaxy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\npopulation of ISOs from the Galaxy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s stellar distribution. Using simulated Galaxies from EAGLE (Schaye et al. 2015),\\\\nthey showed that the water content of ISOs was sensitive to Galactic star formation history. In this work, we develop\\\\nthis method and apply it to the stellar population of the Milky Way, estimated with data from the APOGEE survey, to\\\\npredict a broader set of properties of our own Galaxy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s population of interstellar objects. We predict the distribution\\\\nof ISOs in both their spatial position in the Galaxy and their water mass fraction. By evaluating this distribution at\\\\nthe current position of the Solar System, we predict the properties of the population of ISOs from which the observed\\\\nsample of the 2020s will be drawn, and we compare this to the whole-Galaxy distribution. We then detail a Bayesian\\\\nmethod of comparing the predicted and observed distributions to make inferences about the planetary and Galactic'\",\n          \"b'The Galactic ISO Population 5\\\\nThis particular form for the density profile has the advantage that the Poisson point process likelihood takes the\\\\ntractable form\\\\nlnL(logA , aR, az, \\\\xcf\\\\x840, \\\\xcf\\\\x89) = const + N\\\\x10\\\\nlogA\\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x92aR\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa8R\\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x92R0\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa9 \\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x92az\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa8|z|\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa9+1\\\\n2ln\\\\xcf\\\\x89\\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x92\\\\xcf\\\\x89\\\\n2\\\\x00\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa8\\\\xcf\\\\x842\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa9 \\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x922\\\\xcf\\\\x840\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa8\\\\xcf\\\\x84\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa9+\\\\xcf\\\\x842\\\\n0\\\\x01\\\\x11\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x92X\\\\nfieldZ Z\\\\n\\\\xce\\\\xbb(field , D|logA, aR, az, \\\\xcf\\\\x840, \\\\xcf\\\\x89) dDd\\\\xcf\\\\x84 ,(5)\\\\nwhere the sum over every star in the monoabundance populationP\\\\niln\\\\xce\\\\xbb(Oi|\\\\xce\\\\xb8) in Eq. 1 is reduced to a linear\\\\ncombination of the parameters with aggregates of the data in the monoabundance population being fitted: Nas the\\\\nnumber of stars observed, \\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa8R\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa9and\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa8|z|\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa9as the mean coordinate values, and \\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa8\\\\xcf\\\\x84\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa9and\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa8\\\\xcf\\\\x842\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa9as the mean age and age\\\\nsquared. To build our model of the Milky Way disk between R= 4 kpc \\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x9212 kpc and |z|= 0\\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x925 kpc, we found a\\\\nbest-fit model for each monoabundance population by maximising this likelihood with respect to logA, aR,az,\\\\xcf\\\\x840, and\\\\n\\\\xcf\\\\x89, visually checking each fit to ensure the global maximum had been found. The results are plotted in Figure 1.\\\\nReliable ages are not available for stars [Fe /H]<\\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x920.5 in AstroNN , so for these populations we fit only for logA,\\\\naRandaz. We use an effective selection function dependent only on field and D, calculated assuming a uniform age\\\\ndistribution. While a uniform age distribution is an inaccurate description of a monoabundance population, it is a\\\\nnon-informative assumption that ensures that the effective selection function is never zero where a star may actually\\\\nbe observed. On testing, we found that the effective selection function did not vary strongly with the age distribution\\\\nassumed. Even then, as discussed in the section below, we do not expect stars with metallicity [Fe /H]<\\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x920.5 to\\\\ncontribute a significant number of ISOs, making our conclusions independent of the age distribution assumed for these\\\\nstars.\\\\nThe two main distinct chemodynamical populations of the Milky Way are clearly shown in our model (Fig. 1).\\\\nThe young, high [Fe /H], low [ \\\\xce\\\\xb1/Fe] monoabundance populations have the low vertical scale lengths and high radial\\\\nscale lengths which form the thin disk, whereas the old low [Fe /H], high [ \\\\xce\\\\xb1/Fe] monoabundance populations have the\\\\nopposite trend in scale lengths, forming the thick disk (Mashonkina et al. 2019).\\\\nThis approach gives us simple but accurate models of the trends of the Milky Way disk\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s stellar population. These\\\\nresults agree with the results of Bovy et al. (2016b) which also models monoabundance populations in APOGEE,\\\\nfitting more complex models to only stars in the red clump, using their highly consistent absolute magnitudes as an\\\\naccurate distance measurement.\\\\n2.3. The Sine Morte Stellar Population\\\\nHaving obtained a model for the distribution of red giants in the Milky Way, we then infer the distribution of all\\\\nstars throughout Galactic history. As described in \\\\xc2\\\\xa73.2, ISOs form mostly at the start of their parent star\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s life and\\\\nthen outlive their parent star. Under this constraint, the population of currently living stars is too limited to use to\\\\npredict the ISO population. Instead, we must consider what the stellar population would be at the present time if\\\\nstars did not die, but instead continued to orbit around the Milky Way indefinitely \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 while being subjected to the\\\\nsame dynamical effects that affected both their longer-lived companion stars and the ISOs they had released on similar\\\\norbits. We introduce this as the sine morte4stellar population.\\\\nFirst, we calculate the sine morte number density of stars in each monoabundance population, from the red giant\\\\nnumber density. For this, we use the same PARSEC stellar model isochrones and Kroupa initial mass function with\\\\na minimum mass of 0 .08M\\\\xe2\\\\x8a\\\\x99as in \\\\xc2\\\\xa72. Using the isochrones with metallicities corresponding to each monoabundance\\\\npopulation, weighted by the fitted age distribution g(\\\\xcf\\\\x84|\\\\xcf\\\\x840, \\\\xcf\\\\x89) for that monoabundance population, we calculate\\\\nNgiants/Nsm: the fraction of all stars ever created that are currently in the red giant phase, which is again defined by\\\\n1\\\\xe2\\\\x89\\\\xa4logg <3. Dividing the number density of giants by this fraction gives us the sine morte stellar number density.\\\\nThis assumes that the age distribution of each monoabundance population does not vary significantly across the Milky\\\\nWay disk, which is reasonable for the range of Randzwe are considering (Lian et al. 2022).\\\\nNext, we calculate the sine morte stellar mass density by multiplying the sine morte stellar number density by the\\\\naverage star\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s initial mass, \\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa8Mint\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa9. By definition, the average mass of stars in the sine morte population is the average\\\\ninitial mass, which is only dependent on the initial mass function. Thus we calculate \\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa8Mint\\\\xe2\\\\x9f\\\\xa9from the same Kroupa\\\\n4Latin for \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwithout death\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d, [ \\\"si:ne\\\"mOrte] IPA pronunciation, or \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98seen-ay mort-ay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99.'\",\n          \"b'The Galactic ISO Population 3\\\\nprocesses modelled, and demonstrate this method by constraining the metallicity dependence of the ISO production\\\\nrate.\\\\n2.APOGEE AND STELLAR DENSITY MODELLING\\\\nTo predict the distribution of ISOs in the Milky Way, we first obtain the distribution of all stars throughout Galactic\\\\nhistory over a large swath of the Galactic disk, which we model by fitting simple density profiles to debiased data from\\\\nthe APOGEE survey. While APOGEE\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s main sample is not representative of all extant stars, we can extrapolate from\\\\nit to recover the total stellar population of the Milky Way. By design, the APOGEE main sample mainly contains red\\\\ngiants: stars in a relatively short-lived phase towards the end of their lives. Since each stellar generation forms stars\\\\nwith a range of masses (Chabrier 2003) and a corresponding range of lifespans, all but the newest stellar populations\\\\nwill have some stars currently in the red giant stage. This means multiple generations are represented in the APOGEE\\\\nsample. We then extrapolate to the entire stellar population. This reconstruction is detailed in 2.3.\\\\n2.1. Observational Data: APOGEE\\\\nWe use data from the APOGEE SDSS-IV Data Release 16 (J\\\\xc2\\\\xa8 onsson et al. 2020). APOGEE is a near-infrared,\\\\nhigh-resolution ( R\\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\xbc22 500) spectroscopic stellar survey used to estimate high-precision chemical abundances for a\\\\nsample of over 200 000 Milky Way stars (Majewski et al. 2017). The survey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s simple and well-characterised selection\\\\nfunction, based on apparent magnitude and dereddened colour, is optimised to select red giants (Zasowski et al. 2013,\\\\n2017). As infrared bands suffer less from dust extinction, the red giants selected are visible across the Galactic disk.\\\\nThe high-precision abundance measurements mean that we can identify monoabundance populations with very low\\\\nlevels of contamination by binning the APOGEE stars in [Fe /H] and [ \\\\xce\\\\xb1/Fe] (Bovy et al. 2016b). Additionally, the\\\\nwell-characterised nature of the selection function means that it can easily be accounted for using the method of Bovy\\\\net al. (2016a). This makes APOGEE an ideal choice for modelling the spatial and chemical distribution of the Milky\\\\nWay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s red giant population.\\\\nWe obtain the chemical abundances, heliocentric distance and age of stars in APOGEE DR16. To obtain each star\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nabundances, we use the calibrated ASPCAP pipeline\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s (Garc\\\\xc2\\\\xb4 \\\\xc4\\\\xb1a P\\\\xc2\\\\xb4 erez et al. 2016) abundances of iron [Fe /H] and alpha\\\\nelements [ \\\\xce\\\\xb1/Fe], calculated from an average of the abundances of the elements O, Mg, Si, S, and Ca, after Bovy et al.\\\\n(2016b). For each star\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heliocentric distance and age, we use the weighted dist andagelowess correct estimate of\\\\nAstroNN (Leung & Bovy 2019; Mackereth et al. 2019). weighted dist is a weighted average of the distance estimate\\\\nfrom the Gaia parallax measurement of the star (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016) and a spectro-photometric distance\\\\nestimate of the star from a neural network trained on 265 761 stars surveyed in common between APOGEE DR14\\\\n(Abolfathi et al. 2018; Holtzman et al. 2018) and Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018). agelowess correct is\\\\na measurement of the stellar age from a neural network trained on 6676 stars with both spectroscopic measurement by\\\\nAPOGEE DR14 and asteroseismic age measurement by the Kepler mission (Borucki et al. 2010), corrected for biases\\\\nfrom the neural network as described in Mackereth et al. (2017). Due to a lack of stars with low metallicity in the\\\\ntraining data, reliable ages aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t available for stars with [Fe /H]<\\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x920.5, so for these stars we must assume an age\\\\ndistribution as described below.\\\\nThe APOGEE DR16 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cstatistical sample\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (the sample of stars for which the selection function can be reconstructed)\\\\ncontains 165,768 stars. However, this is partly made up of dwarfs, which have higher uncertainties in their atmospheric\\\\nparameters and abundances. We thus select a subset of the statistical sample with a calibrated ASPCAP surface gravity\\\\nof 1\\\\xe2\\\\x89\\\\xa4logg <3. We additionally select only stars with fractional uncertainty in heliocentric distance Dof less than\\\\n0.5. To restrict our sample to the Milky Way\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s disk, we select stars with Galactocentric radii Rbetween 4 kpc and\\\\n12 kpc and height above the disk zof\\\\xe2\\\\x88\\\\x925 kpc to 5 kpc. This gives us a sample of 80 958 red giants.\\\\n2.2. Density Modelling of Red Giants across the Galaxy\\\\nTo calculate the distribution of red giant stars in the Milky Way from the APOGEE data we use the method of\\\\nBovy et al. (2016a), as this accounts for both dust and the survey selection function simultaneously. In brief, assuming\\\\nthe stars observed in a survey are distributed independently in a space of some observables O(for example position,\\\\ncolour and magnitude, chemical abundances), then the positions of Nstars in the space of observables O1, . . . , O Nis\\\\na realisation of an inhomogeneous Poisson point process. This process is a random distribution of points defined by a\\\\nrate function \\\\xce\\\\xbb(O), such that the number of points in a given volume Vin the space of the observables is a Poisson\\\\nrandom variable with mean and variance equal to the integral of the rate function over that volume,R\\\\nV\\\\xce\\\\xbb(O) dO.

            "Planet formation occurs within protoplanetary disks, which are composed of gas and dust surrounding young stars. These disks provide the necessary material for the formation of planetesimals, which are the building blocks of planets. As dust particles collide and stick together, they form larger bodies, eventually leading to the creation of planetesimals. Over time, these planetesimals can collide and merge, forming larger objects that may become planets. The process is influenced by various factors, including the metallicity of the star, which affects the availability of materials necessary for planet formation. Additionally, dynamical interactions, such as scattering by giant planets or close stellar flybys, can eject some of these bodies into interstellar space, contributing to the population of interstellar objects.\n"
