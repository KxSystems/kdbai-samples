Bears are large mammals with a stocky body, powerful limbs, and a short tail. They have a large brain and are considered among the most intelligent of animals. While many bears are omnivorous, their diets can range from primarily plant-based to entirely carnivorous, depending on the species. They are found in various habitats across the Americas, Europe, and Asia.
