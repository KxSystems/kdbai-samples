Caterpillars are the larval stage of butterflies and moths. They have a segmented body with a distinct head and typically several pairs of true legs, as well as additional false legs or prolegs. Caterpillars are primarily known for their voracious appetite, often eating leaves voraciously before pupating into their adult form.
