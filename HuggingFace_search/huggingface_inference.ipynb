    "# Why Use Hugging Face for Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "When building production applications that utilize embeddings, it's often advantageous to use open-source embedding models for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Control**: Open-source models give developers more control over the embeddings process, reducing dependence on third-party embedding providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Local Embedding**: With open-source models, you can create embeddings locally, which is particularly useful for embedding your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common approach is to use a Python framework like sentence-transformers, developed by Hugging Face, which offers state-of-the-art sentence, text, and image embeddings. Here's a typical workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embed your dataset locally**: Use a library like Sentence Transformers to embed your dataset, which might consist of AI tools and associated metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embed queries at inference time**: When a user submits a query, use an external service like Hugging Face's Inference API to embed the query. This eliminates the need to deploy your own model, allowing you to leverage a fully optimized external service.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this approach, you can build a system that searches through hundreds of AI tools without the need to deploy any infrastructure (and scale to millions!). Additionally, since you embed the dataset locally, you can use Hugging Face's free plan without requiring a credit card or worrying about hitting rate limits, at least until you are ready for production.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of embedding a dataset of AI tools using Sentence Transformers, and then using Hugging Face's Inference API to embed queries at inference time, enabling efficient and scalable search capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need a Hugging Face api token for this sample. Please create a Hugging Face account by going to [Hugging Face – The AI community building the future](https://huggingface.co/) and create a token by going to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then enter this token below or set it to HF_TOKEN in your environment."
