        "PDFs and other complex document types are notoriously difficult to work with, yet are the common file formats used for publishing important business related information. Since these file types are so common, it is key to have the capability to parse and ingest these documents swiftly, with accuracy, while cleanly extracting embedded entities such as images, tables, and graphs. If extracted correctly, all of the data held in a complex document like a PDF can be ingested into a RAG workflow to generate accurate and contextual responses for users and the business.\n",
        "\n",
        "This sample will illustrate how to use Unstructured, a complex document parsing technology, to ingest complex documentation, partition it into useful elements, perform chunking and embedding, and finally store the embeddings in KDB.AI. After this, we can complete a RAG pipeline with LangChain and query the KDB.AI vector database to retrieve the most relevant elements and pass them to an LLM to generate a response.\n",

            "Based on the provided financial metrics and their changes over the reported periods, I would assign a sentiment score of **8** for the outlook of Meta Platforms, Inc. Here’s the reasoning:\n",
            "\n",
            "### Positive Indicators:\n",
            "1. **Revenue Growth**: Revenue increased by 22% from Q2 2023 to Q2 2024, indicating strong top-line growth.\n",
            "2. **Income from Operations**: This surged by 58%, showing improved operational efficiency and higher profitability.\n",
            "3. **Operating Margin**: Improved significantly from 29% to 38%, suggesting better cost management and higher profitability per dollar of revenue.\n",
            "4. **Net Income**: Increased by 73%, reflecting robust bottom-line growth.\n",
            "5. **Diluted EPS**: Similarly, this metric rose by 73%, indicating higher earnings per share for shareholders.\n",
            "6. **Total Stockholders' Equity**: Increased from $153,168 million at the end of 2023 to $156,763 million by mid-2024, which is a positive sign for shareholder value.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Mixed Indicators:\n",
            "1. **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss**: Increased from $(2,155) million to $(2,695) million. While this is a negative indicator, its impact is generally less direct on the company’s operational performance.\n",
            "2. **Retained Earnings**: Decreased slightly from $82,070 million to $81,188 million. This could indicate dividend payments or other distributions, but it is minor in the context of overall financial health.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Neutral/Stable Indicators:\n",
            "1. **Total Assets**: Increased marginally from $229,623 million to $230,238 million, indicating stability in the asset base.\n",
            "2. **Effective Tax Rate**: Decreased from 16% to 11%, which can be a positive sign but also needs to be sustainable over the long term.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Conclusion:\n",
            "The significant improvements in revenue, income from operations, net income, and EPS indicate a very positive financial outlook. The increase in stockholders' equity and stable asset base further support this positive sentiment. Despite the slight increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss and a minor drop in retained earnings, the overall financial health and performance of the company are robust.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thus, a sentiment score of **8** reflects strong confidence in Meta Platforms, Inc.'s financial outlook, with considerations for minor areas that could be monitored for future improvements.\n",

            "Non Contextualized\n",
            "-----\n",
            "Based on the provided context, I would give the outlook a sentiment score of **7 out of 10**. Here's the reasoning behind this score:\n",
            "\n",
            "### Positive Indicators:\n",
            "1. **Revenue Growth**: The projected total revenue for the third quarter of 2024 is in the range of $38.5-41 billion, indicating expected growth.\n",
            "2. **Stable Expense Guidance**: Full-year 2024 total expenses are expected to remain in the range of $96-99 billion, unchanged from prior outlook.\n",
            "3. **Capital Expenditure Plans**: The company anticipates increased capital expenditures, particularly for artificial intelligence research and product development efforts, suggesting a focus on future growth and innovation.\n",
            "4. **Tax Rate Stability**: The tax rate for full-year 2024 is expected to be in the mid-teens, showing a predictable tax landscape.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Negative Indicators:\n",
            "1. **Operating Losses for Reality Labs**: Continued and increasing operating losses for Reality Labs due to ongoing product development efforts.\n",
            "2. **Regulatory Headwinds**: Active and increasing legal and regulatory challenges in the EU and the U.S. could significantly impact business and financial results.\n",
            "3. **Foreign Currency Headwinds**: A 2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth due to foreign currency exchange rates.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Neutral/Uncertain Indicators:\n",
            "1. **Infrastructure Costs**: Expected significant expense growth in 2025 due to infrastructure costs, which is a mixed signal as it indicates higher spending but also potential for future scalability.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, while there are some challenges and uncertainties, the guidance reflects an overall positive outlook with strong revenue growth expectations, stable expenses, and significant investments in future growth areas like AI. The sentiment score of 7 reflects this cautiously optimistic perspective.\n"
