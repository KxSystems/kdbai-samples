    "# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "This example will demonstrate how to use an advanced prompt engineering technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), with hands-on examples using Langchain, KDB.AI and various LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is RAG and Why Do We Need it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models have remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text. These models are found in applications ranging from chatbots to content generation and translation. However, they face a significant challenge in staying up-to-date with recent world events, as they are essentially frozen in time, operating within the static knowledge snapshot captured during their training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To bridge this gap and address the need for specialized, real-time information, the concept of \"Retrieval Augmented Generation\" (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution. RAG enables these language models to access relevant data from external knowledge bases, enriching their responses with current and contextually accurate information. For more content on RAG you can check out our videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@KxSystems/streams) where we discuss the best practices for RAG, chunking strategies, the variety of approaches as well as how to evaluate your RAG application.\n",
