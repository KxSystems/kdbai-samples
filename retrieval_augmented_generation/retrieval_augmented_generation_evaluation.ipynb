    "# Retrieval Augmented Generation Evaluation with LangChain and KDB.AI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a guide to utilizing LangChain tooling for evaluating a basic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation process involves employing [LangChain's String Evaluators](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/evaluation/string/) to assess both conciseness and correctness. KDB.AI serves as the primary knowledge base, enabling the retrieval of semantically relevant content for the evaluation.\n",

    "This notebook focuses on the evaluation of your retrieval augmented generation using KDB.AI as the vector store.\n",

    "1. Define OpenAI Text Emedding Model\n",
    "1. Store Embeddings In KDB.AI\n",
