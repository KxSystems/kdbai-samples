    "## Hybrid Search\n",
    "KDB.AI hybrid search is a method of similarity search to increase the relevancy of results retrieved from the vector database. It combines two search methods: sparse vector search, and dense vector search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse vector search uses the BM25 algorithm to find the most relevant keyword matches, while dense vector search finds the most semantically relevant matches. \n",
    "\n",
    "In KDB.AI, users can run sparse or dense search independently, or run hybrid search which runs both sparse and dense vector searches and then re-ranks to combine the results of each search based on a user defined \"alpha\" value. An alpha value closer to 0 indicates a higher sparse search weight, while a value closer to 1 indicates a higher dense search weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sample we will use hybrid search over a Federal Reserve speech to extract chunks of the speech that are similar to a user's prompt. In this notebook we will chunk up the document into smaller subsections, create sparse and dense vectors of the chunks, store the vectors in the KDB.AI vector database, and then run dense search, sparse search, and hybrid search to retrieve the most relevant chunks to a user's query. \n",

       "0    At last year's Jackson Hole symposium, I delivered a brief, direct message. My remarks this year will be a bit longer, but the message is the same: It is the Fed's job to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal, and we will do so. We have tightened policy significantly over the past year. Although inflation has moved down from its peak—a welcome development—it remains too high. We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we   \n",

       "4  The ongoing episode of high inflation initially emerged from a collision between very strong demand and pandemic-constrained supply. By the time the Federal Open Market Committee raised the policy rate in March 2022, it was clear that bringing down inflation would depend on both the unwinding of the unprecedented pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and on our tightening of monetary policy, which would slow the growth of aggregate demand, allowing supply time to catch up.
